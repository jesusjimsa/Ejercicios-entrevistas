'''
    A non-empty array `A` consisting of `N` integers is given. The consecutive elements of array `A` represent
    consecutive cars on a road.

    Array `A` contains only 0s and/or 1s:

    * `0` represents a car traveling east,
    * `1` represents a car traveling west.

    The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars `(P, Q)`, where `0 â‰¤ P < Q < N`, is passing when `P`
    is traveling to the east and `Q` is traveling to the west.

    For example, consider array `A` such that:
    ```
    A[0] = 0
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 0
    A[3] = 1
    A[4] = 1
    ```

    We have five pairs of passing cars: `(0, 1)`, `(0, 3)`, `(0, 4)`, `(2, 3)`, `(2, 4)`.

    Write a function:
    ```
    def solution(A)
    ```

    that, given a non-empty array `A` of `N` integers, returns the number of pairs of passing cars.

    The function should return `-1` if the number of pairs of passing cars exceeds `1,000,000,000`.

    For example, given:
    ```
    A[0] = 0
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 0
    A[3] = 1
    A[4] = 1
    ```

    the function should return `5`, as explained above.

    Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

    * `N` is an integer within the range `[1..100,000]`;
    * Each element of array `A` is an integer that can have one of the following values: `0`, `1`.
