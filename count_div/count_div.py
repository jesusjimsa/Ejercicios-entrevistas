'''
    Write a function:
    ```
    def solution(A, B, K)
    ```

    that, given three integers `A`, `B` and `K`, returns the number of integers within the range `[A..B]` that are
    divisible by `K`, i.e.:
    ```
    { i : A ≤ i ≤ B, i mod K = 0 }
    ```

    For example, for `A = 6`, `B = 11` and `K = 2`, your function should return `3`, because there are three numbers
    divisible by `2` within the range `[6..11]`, namely `6`, `8` and `10`.

    Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

    * `A` and `B` are integers within the range `[0..2,000,000,000]`;
    * `K` is an integer within the range `[1..2,000,000,000]`;
    * `A ≤ B`.

def solution(A, B, K):
    '''
    Number of integer in range [A..B] that are divisible by K.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : Int
        Start of range.
    B : Int
        End of range.
    K : Int
        Number to find divs.

    Returns
    -------
    : Int
        Number of divs by K.

    inclusive = 0

    if A % K == 0:
        inclusive = 1

    return int((B / K) - (A / K) + inclusive)
