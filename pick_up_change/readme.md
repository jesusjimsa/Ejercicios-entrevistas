# Description

Given a 2D `n x m` matrix where each cell has a certain amount of change on the floor, your goal is to start from the top left corner `mat[0][0]` and end in the bottom right corner `mat[n - 1][m - 1]` with the most amount of change. You can only move either right or down.

Here's some starter code:

```Python
def max_change(mat):
    # Fill this in.

mat = [
    [0, 3, 0, 2],
    [1, 2, 3, 3],
    [6, 0, 3, 2]
]

print(max_change(mat))
# 13
```
