# Description

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

Given an integer `n`, return true if `n` is an ugly number.

### Example 1:
```C
Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
```

### Example 2:
```C
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
```

### Example 3:
```C
Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
```

## Constraints:

* `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
