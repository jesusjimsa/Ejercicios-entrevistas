# Description

We are given a matrix M of the order m x n, and we have to print its elements as we traverse it in spiral form.

Example:

```
matrix = [
    [13, 14, 17, 27],
    [81, 52, 31, 10],
    [12, 55, 23, 78]
]

Output: [13, 14, 17, 27, 10, 78, 23, 55, 12, 81, 52, 31]
```

Solved in Python.
