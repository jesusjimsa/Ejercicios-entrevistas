# Description

You are implementing a binary search tree class which, in addition to `insert`, `find` and `delete`, has a method `getRandomNode()` which returns a random node from the tree. All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen.

Design and implement an algorithm foor `getRandomNode()`, and explain how you would implement the rest of the methods.

Solved in C++.
