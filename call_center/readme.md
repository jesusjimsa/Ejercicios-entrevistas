# Description

Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondents, manager and director. An incoming telephone
call must be first allocated to a respondant who is free. If the respondant can't handle the call, he or she must
escalate the call to a manager. If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated
to a director.

1. Design the classes and data structures for this problem.
2. Implement a method `dispatchCall()` which assigns a call to the first available employee.
